# SpO2-Algorithm

This algorithm is based on obtaining the oxygen saturation that a person is sensing through an oximetry sensor max30102. 
It is an example of the sensor library implemented in Arduino and with some modifications.

If you want to collaborate with us to improve the code, we would be happy to work together.
